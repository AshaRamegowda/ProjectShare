No unit test cases !

1. CreateImport.java and AppendImport.java
- main method is very complex with too many if/else statements
- It is not advisable to catch throwable (specific exceptions should be caught)
- printStackTrace() should not be used instead we should have proper loggers
- Duplicate code between CreateImport.java and AppendImport.java can be moved to common class and can be reused
- In the if statements, the string literals have to be on left side (Eg : "-i".equals(args[2]) instead of args[2].equals("-i")) to avoid null pointer exception

2. BioStreamInterface.java
- Too many lines of code in the class
- method ActionPerformed does not follow the naming convention camel case
- method ActionPerformed is complex with many if/else statements
- some of the if statements can be combined as the code is duplicated or we can use Enums to separate the actions
- method should not have many exit points (i mean return statements) which leads to confusion

3. BioStreamUtil.java
- Util classes should not have public constructor
- Util class should be final
- some of the methods are very complex with more lines
- the local variable names should be meaningful
